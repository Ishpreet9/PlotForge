Original story idea: "${userIdea}"

Instructions:
1. Generate exactly 5 story ideas that are very similar to the original.
2. Only use elements from the original story (characters, objects, relationships, setting, theme).
3. Do NOT introduce any new characters, objects, or unrelated events.
4. Each idea must be a single sentence.
5. Output must be a valid JSON array of strings ONLY.
6. Example:

Original story idea: "A story of a child and a dog"

Similar story ideas:
[
  "A child and their dog find a hidden path in the forest and explore it together",
  "A young child teaches their dog a special trick that helps them solve a problem",
  "A child and their dog go on a small adventure in the neighborhood",
  "A child loses their dog for a day and learns the value of friendship",
  "A child and dog discover a secret place where they can play every day"
]

  "The child meets the dog for the very first time at an animal shelter",

Instructions:
1. Write 5-7 possible next events for the story to continue.
2. The events should be different possible continuations, not a single linear storyline.
3. Each event must be a short single sentence.
4. Use the names, characters, and objects already mentioned in the "Story so far". Do NOT introduce new characters or names.
5. If you think the story has been good and might need and ending, give some choices which are an ending event after which the stoy ends, use (end) at the end of that array element.
6. Output must be a valid JSON array of strings ONLY.
7. Example:

Story so far: [
  "The child finds a mysterious key in the attic",

  "The key glows faintly as the child holds it tighter",
