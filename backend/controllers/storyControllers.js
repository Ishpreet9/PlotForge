Original story idea: "${userIdea}"

Instructions:
1. Generate exactly 5 story ideas that are very similar to the original.
2. Only use elements from the original story (characters, objects, relationships, setting, theme).
3. Do NOT introduce any new characters, objects, or unrelated events.
4. Each idea must be a single sentence.
5. Output must be a valid JSON array of strings ONLY.
6. Example:

Original story idea: "A story of a child and a dog"

Similar story ideas:
[
  "A child and their dog find a hidden path in the forest and explore it together",
  "A young child teaches their dog a special trick that helps them solve a problem",
  "A child and their dog go on a small adventure in the neighborhood",
  "A child loses their dog for a day and learns the value of friendship",
  "A child and dog discover a secret place where they can play every day"

Story so far: ${stEvents}

Instructions:
1. Write 5-7 possible next events for the story to continue.
2. The events should be different possible continuations, not a single linear storyline.
3. Each event must be a short single sentence.
4. Use the names, characters, and objects already mentioned in the "Story so far". Do NOT introduce new characters or names.
5. If you think the story has been good and might need and ending, give some choices which are an ending event after which the stoy ends, use (end) at the end of that array element.
6. Output must be a valid JSON array of strings ONLY.
7. Example:

Story so far: [
  "The child finds a mysterious key in the attic",
  "The dog starts barking at the locked basement door"
]

Events:
${stEvents}

Instructions:
1. Create a single compelling story title based on the events.
2. Write the complete story in prose form by combining all the events into a smooth narrative.
3. Do NOT skip or add extra events outside of the given ones.
4. Make sure the story flows naturally and reads like a short story.
5. Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly two strings:
   - The first string is the title.
   - The second string is the complete story.

Example:

Events: [
  "The child finds a mysterious key in the attic",
  "The dog starts barking at the locked basement door",
  "The child slowly approaches the door"
]

Output:
[
  "The Secret in the Basement",
  "One rainy afternoon, a curious child stumbled upon a mysterious key in the dusty attic. As they turned it over in their hand, the dog began barking furiously at the locked basement door. Heart racing, the child clutched the key tightly and slowly approached the door, unsure of what secrets might be waiting beyond."
