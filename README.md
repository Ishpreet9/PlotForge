PlotForge is an interactive story-building platform that lets users create branching narratives step by step.

Key Features:

- Start with a story idea or overview.

- Explore multiple branching paths for your story.

- Make choices step by step, controlling the flow of the narrative.

- Compile all chosen nodes into a final story with AI assistance.
